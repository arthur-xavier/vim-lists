Author: Arthur Xavier
License: vim-license, see |license|

This plugin defines a set of commands for working with the QuickFix and
Location lists.  The commands prefer the QuickFix list if it's open, falling
back to the Location list if the other one does not exists or isn't visible.

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

                                                *:Lopen* *:Lo*
:Lo[pen]        Open the quickfix list if a quickfix buffer exists. If not,
                attempt to open the location list.

                                                *:Lclose* *:Lc*
:Lc[lose]       Close the quickfix list if it's open, or else, attemp to close
                the location list.

                                                *:Lwindow* *:Lw*
:Lw[indow]      Open the quickfix list when there exists a quickfix buffer, or
                else attempt open the location list window. If the location list
                window is already open, close it; but if the quickfix window is
                open, close it instead.

                                                *:Llist* *:Ll*

                item in the quickfix list and jump to the specified buffer and
                line. If the quickfix window is closed, attempt to do the same
                for the location list.

                                                *:Lnext* *:Ln*
:Ln[ext]        Display the next error in the quickfix list that includes a
                file name, if the quickfix window is open. If it's not, then
                display the next error in the location list that includes a
                file name.

                                                *:Lprev* *:Lp*
:Lp[rev]        Display the previous error in the quickfix list that includes a
                file name, if the quickfix window is open. If it's not, then
                display the previous error in the location list that includes a
                file name.
